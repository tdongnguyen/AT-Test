# AT technical test

A small project to test technical skills for Data Scientist Role in Auckland Transport

## Description

This project is a technical test , part of the recruitment process for the Data Scientist Role in Auckland Transport. In this project, author use the provided dataset and follow a guideline from AT. This project is basically building a fraud detection unsupervised model, pack it up as a package and prepare a presentation for findings. 

## Business Problem

* Technical Test for candidate
* Fraud Dectection
* Scaleable model building
* Find applicable insights to support business 

## Method and results

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* mice (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations)
* Machine Learning Algorithm: Isolation Forest (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html
Data Visualization
Predictive Modeling
etc.

First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.

## Running instructions

### Dependencies
Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
ex. Windows 10
### Installing
How/where to download your program
Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders
### Executing program
How to run the program
Step-by-step bullets
Clone this repo (for help see this tutorial).

Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)

Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)

etc...

If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here

Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)


Explain to potential users how to run/replicate your workflow. If necessary, touch upon the required input data, which secret credentials are required (and how to obtain them), which software tools are needed to run the workflow (including links to the installation instructions), and how to run the workflow.
