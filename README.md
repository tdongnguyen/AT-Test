Raw Data is being kept [here](Technical test sample data.ods) within this repo.

Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)

etc...

If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here

Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)


Explain to potential users how to run/replicate your workflow.
